\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Now that this period of my life is upon its dawn, it is time to thank everyone who accompanied me through this journey which has seen me grow both as an individual and as a professional. Without your support this adventure would not have been the same.

To the \(\rho\)7 Boyz, João Pereira, José Pinto, Henrique Ferrolho, Luís Reis and João Dias, as well as Sara Paiva and Beatriz Baldaia, the residents of Lab I120, thank you for all the good moments.

To my parents and my brother for always being there for me, offering sage advice and true friendship. Thank you to my girlfriend Cátia Matos, who on a daily basis helped me face the toughest problems and overcome the greatest challenges.

To all my friends who showed a great degree of interest with this project, always ready to help, João Paiva, Jorge Wolfs, Sara Serra, Margarida Borges and Tomás Matos, thank you all. 

I would also like thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Rosaldo Rossetti for his guidance throughout the project as well as shedding some light into my professional life, and my second supervisor Diogo Santos for helping me take my first steps in the world of computer vision.
