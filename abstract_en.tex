\chapter*{Abstract}

Traffic management is one of the most important and crucial tasks in modern cities, due to the increasing number of vehicles in the under dimensioned road networks. To aid in this task multiple solutions exist that simulate the networks behaviour taking for input data from traditional counting methods such as magnetic induction loops. These devices present flaws and are expensive to implement. With the decreasing cost of video cameras and the wide-spread use of computer vision, their use became a viable alternative to analyse traffic.

In this project we tackle the problem of automatic traffic surveillance using video cameras, developing a video analytics processor that will perform detection and classification tasks over gathered data. This processor was integrated in a solution under development that treats videos from multiple sources and provides computer vision as an on-line service.

A novel approach to the vehicle classification process is presented, based on the use of a fuzzy set. To illustrate the proposed approach, the detection and classification implemented were tested with different cameras in different scenarios, showing promising results.
